# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. This project showcases the application of data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and the development of a logistic regression model.

## Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Gain insights into the data by examining summary statistics and visualizing various aspects.
   - Identify patterns and relationships between features and the target variable (survival).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values effectively.
   - Encode categorical variables appropriately.
   - Select relevant features for model building.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using key metrics.

## Steps Involved

### Data Exploration and Visualization

- Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
- Created visualizations to illustrate survival rates by gender, class, and age distribution, providing clear insights into the factors affecting survival.

### Data Preprocessing

- Addressed missing values by filling in appropriate values based on data characteristics.
- Transformed categorical variables into a suitable format for modeling using one-hot encoding.
- Selected the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model.

### Model Building and Evaluation

- Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model.
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of passenger survival.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, which provided insights into the model's performance and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data science methodologies to a real-world dataset. By performing EDA, data preprocessing, and logistic regression modeling, we successfully predicted passenger survival on the Titanic. The insights gained and the model's evaluation metrics highlight the effectiveness of the approach and potential areas for future enhancement.
